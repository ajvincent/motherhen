First, I need to find an existing Motherhen configuration file, or a location
to create one.  Don't worry about the files and directories not existing: this
will only edit or create the Motherhen configuration file, and only at the end
of this process.  Instead, I'll ask you to provide an existing directory, and
then a relative path from this directory to the configuration file, even if
intermediate directories do not exist.
