Indeed, the day is upon us when the Beast shall reside with the Hen,
following the birds of Thunder and the monkeys of the Sea.  Yea, even the Griffons
of the Blue realm would smile upon this day.  <em>Weep not</em> for the years and <em>Decades</em>
which have passed in Darkness.
I tell you, the Hen shall raise <em>Many</em> chicks for the Beast, and among them,
the Runner shall be <em>Reborn</em> to run free <em>Forever</em>...
