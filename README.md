# "New Mozilla Application" Template

If you want to use Mozilla's build system to create a new application, with compiled code and/or tests, you should start here.  This is a template for the absolute minimum code you need for starting a new application source tree in mozilla-central.

As such, you should expect to do a few string replacements.  Run create-application.py to create and configure your new project.

This project is very much a work in progress.
