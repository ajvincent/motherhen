# "New Mozilla Application" Template

If you want to use Mozilla's build system to create a new application, with compiled code and/or tests, you should start here.  This is a template for the absolute minimum code you need for starting a new application source tree in mozilla-central.

As such, you should expect to do a few string replacements.  Run create-application.py to create and configure your new project.

This project is very much a work in progress.  **DO NOT USE YET!!**

## Building

First, create a folder to house your application for development:
```bash
mkdir newapp-cleandir
cd newapp-cleandir
```

Then clone the firefox source code, either via `git clone` or `hg clone`:
```bash
hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/
# Alternatively (might be faster):
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev mozilla-central
```

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajvincent/motherhen gh-newapp
```

Keep track of the location of `mozilla-central`:
```bash
echo $PWD/mozilla-central > gh-newapp/.moz-central
```

Now, we need to add our app to the gecko source code:
```bash
# On linux add -r to each of the following commands
ln -s gh-newapp/boilerplate mozilla-central/newapp
ln -s gh-newapp/newapp-sym.mozconfig mozilla-central/.mozconfig
```

Apply custom patches:
```bash
cd gh-newapp
./patches.sh import
cd ..
```

Configure and build your application:
```bash
cd mozilla-central
./mach configure
./mach build
```

Then run it:
```bash
./mach run
```
